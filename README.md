# openmole.plugin.dtw: Dynamic Time Warping plugin for OpenMOLE

## Feature 

This [OpenMOLE](https://next.openmole.org/) [plugin](https://next.openmole.org/Plugin+Development.html) brings [Dynamic Time Warp [DTW]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping) metrics so they can be used in OpenMOLE.

A typical example is to compare two time series during a calibration process, one being measured, the other one generated by a simulation. In the course of simulation, you might be willing to calibrate the simulation so the resulting load curves are similar. Yet what does "similar" means here? Dynamic Time Warp, among other methods, is a way to compare load curves and accept time shifts between two curves better than with a Mean Squarred Error [MSE] or equivalent. 

## Who did it? 

This plugin only wraps the existing Java code from: https://github.com/rmaestre/FastDTW

And wraps it as an [osgi plugin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi) so it can be loaded into [OpenMOLE](https://next.openmole.org/) 

# Usage 

## Install it 

* download [the last release](./releases/latest)
* in the GUI of OpenMOLE, load the plugin

## Use it  

The typical usage is from an OpenMOLE [ScalaTask](https://next.openmole.org/Scala.html).

```
val simulatedCurve = Val[Array[Double]]
val refCurve = Val[Array[Double]]

val diffDWT = Val[Double]
val diffMSE = Val[Double]


val dwtTask = ScalaTask("""
    val diffDWT = ch.resear.samthiriot.openmole.plugins.dtw.DTW.getFastWarpDistBetween(simulatedCurve, refCurve)
    val diffMSE = ch.resear.samthiriot.openmole.plugins.dtw.DTW.getMSE(simulatedCurve, refCurve)
    """) set (
        
    inputs += simulatedCurve,
    inputs += refCurve,
    
    outputs += diffDWT,
    outputs += diffMSE,
    
    plugins += pluginsOf[ch.resear.samthiriot.openmole.plugins.dtw.DTW],
    
    simulatedCurve := Array(0.0,0.1,0.2,0.5,0.3,0.1,0.0,0.0),
    refCurve := Array(0.1,0.2,0.5,0.3,0.1,0.0,0.0,0.0)
)

The available metrics are:
* [Dynamic Time Warping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping): `DTW.getWarpDistBetween[Array(Double),Array(Double)]`
* [Fast Dynamic Time Warping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping): `DTW.getFastWarpDistBetween[Array(Double),Array(Double)]`
* [Mean Squared Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error): `DTW.getMSE[Array(Double),Array(Double)]`
* Squared Mean Squared Error: `DTW.getRMSE[Array(Double),Array(Double)]` 
* [Mean absolute error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error):`DTW.getMAE[Array(Double),Array(Double)]`
